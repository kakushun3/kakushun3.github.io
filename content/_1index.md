      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        Iâ€™m currently a masterâ€™s student at Kyushu University, majoring in Plasma and Quantum Science and Engineering. My research focuses on magnetic turbulence and energy transport in the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) of the spherical tokamak QUEST.
    
        I investigate magnetic fluctuations in the SOL using a fast movable probe (FMP) combined with new diagnostic techniques. By comparing experimental results with simulations, I aim to clarify the generation mechanisms of magnetic fluctuations and their impact on cross-field transport.

        I also develop and apply a heat flux measurement system using a calorimeter array on the divertor plate, to quantitatively evaluate the SOL width and assess how upstream fluctuations influence downstream energy flow.

        Feel free to contact me for collaboration or discussion on tokamak diagnostics and turbulence studies
